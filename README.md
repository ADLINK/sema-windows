**The Smart Embedded Management Agent (SEMA速)**

Downtime of devices or systems is not acceptable in today's industries. To help customers to analyze their systems and take counter measures for preventive maintenance. We provide the solution which is able to monitor and collect system performance and status information from the hardware in a timely.

A Board Management Controller is embedded on our hardware and collects all relevant technical information from the chipset through the different communication interfaces such as eSPI, I2C and SMBus.

SEMA速 middleware is on the top of Board controller that provides a ready-made application that shows the data in user-friendly graphic interfaces, suitable for supervision and troubleshooting.

Important Notice
-----
SEMA4.0 would be designed the abstraction layer to integrate the different controllers (EC, TivaBCC and LiteBMC) and this integration will be ready in Q4 2022.

SEMA EAPI Library provides you the interface which can be accessed to the drivers and controllers
<br>
    <strong>Note:</strong> EAPI (Embedded API) library: PICMG速 organization defined the software specification on COM Express for the industrial applications. Here is the available specification https://www.picmg.org/wp-content/uploads/COM_EAPI_R1_0.pdf for your reference.
